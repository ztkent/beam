## Map Maker

- placing large textures gets weird, since the tile below them are rendered on top of them.
- we need a way to mark that some textures need to be rendered on another pass.
  - probably default pass, then go through and render anything marked. we can mark them with an int, so we can have rendering layers.

- item tiles. that way we can keep the textures, tiles, and items separate.
