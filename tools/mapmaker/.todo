# TODO

- i need 'complex' textures. via tile select menu
  - i need alternating textures. so i can place them in a grid and they alternate. kind of an animation.

- add show highlight/tilegrid toggles

- item tiles. that way we can keep the textures, tiles, and items separate.

- some texture packs are different dimensions throughout the pack.
  - i dont know if i will reasonably choose to support this.

- Add color picker - alternative to texture

- when first loading assets, pull them into a local cache (.cache)
  - refer to the local cache for using
- when saving/loading a project include their assets

- export it as a spritesheet
